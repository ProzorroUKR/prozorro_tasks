task_acks_late = True
# Default: Disabled.
# Late ack means the task messages will be acknowledged after the task has been executed,
# not just before (the default behavior).

task_reject_on_worker_lost = True
# Default: Disabled.
# Even if task_acks_late is enabled, the worker will acknowledge tasks
# when the worker process executing them abruptly exits or is signaled (e.g., KILL/INT, etc).
# Setting this to true allows the message to be re-queued instead,
# so that the task will execute again by the same worker, or another worker.

broker_connection_max_retries = None
# Default: 100.
# Maximum number of retries before we give up re-establishing a connection to the AMQP broker.
# If this is set to 0 or None, we’ll retry forever.

task_ignore_result = True
# Default: Disabled.
# Whether to store the task return values or not (tombstones).
# If you still want to store errors, just not successful return values,
# you can set task_store_errors_even_if_ignored.

task_track_started = True
# Default: Disabled.
# If True the task will report its status as ‘started’ when the task is executed by a worker.
# The default value is False as the normal behavior is to not report that level of granularity.
# Tasks are either pending, finished, or waiting to be retried.
# Having a ‘started’ state can be useful for when there are long running tasks
# and there’s a need to report what task is currently running.

worker_send_task_events = True
# Default: Disabled by default.
# If enabled, a task-sent event will be sent for every task so tasks can be tracked before they’re consumed by a worker.

# Celery will automatically retry sending messages in the event of connection failure,
# and retry behavior can be configured – like how often to retry,
# or a maximum number of retries – or disabled all together.
